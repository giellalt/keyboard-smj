# Documentation for the Lule Sami keyboards

This repo defines several keyboards for Lule SÃ¡mi:

- desktop keyboards for Norway (Windows and macOS)
- desktop keyboards for Sweden (Windows and macOS)
- a ChromeOS keyboard, based on the Windows keyboard layout
- mobile keyboard layouts for Android, iPhones, and small and large iPads

In all cases, the layout is based on the standard Norwegian or Swedish keyboards.
This means that everything that is not specific to South Sami is exactly where it is on the standard Norwegian or Swedish keyboard.
